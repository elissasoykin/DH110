# Contextual Inquiry

## Introductory Steps

### Step 1: Specify the research goals and requirements

**What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing?**
>This project allow users to more easily create lists of movies that they want to watch with friends/family members, and keep track of movies that may be special among their group of friends or their family. This will hopefully allow for people to connect with each other (specifically, with individuals that one knows), in the context of movie watching and film, more easily.

**What is the basic need involved for that activity?**
>This activity addresses the userâ€™s need for social belonging and love because it provides a way to bond and connect with people they know, over the topic of movies.

**What is/are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?**
>One type of current solution is dedicated websites or apps for movie tracking. For example, this includes Letterboxd, IMDB, Moviemate, and others. The other type of current solution is not using a dedicated app. Rather, this could involve users making iPhone notes, Google Docs, Word documents, Excel sheets / Google sheets, etc. It also refers to keeping track with pen and paper. 

**What is/are the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?**
>While there are several sites for tracking and logging movies and making lists, almost none of them place any emphasis or even have a possibility for creating shared, collaborative movie lists. Letterboxd does not allow for shared/collaborative movie lists; IMDB might be able to but has a less aesthetically pleasing design. Moviemate allows for collaborative movie lists but has very little features and functionality compared to Letterboxd or IMDB. The non-app methods allow for collaboration (eg, shared Google Doc), but do not have a convenient database of movie information integrated in.

### Step 2: Identify target users

**What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise)**
>Demographic: people of age early teens and older, probably with less users in senior age. People who like to watch movies, and would like to watch with certain people. 

>Preferences: users like to watch films, and share them with others that they know, and so they would like to make collaborative movie lists

>Expertise: users do not need any particular level of expertise to use this application

**Where would the users do that activity?**
>Using a website (ex, Letterboxd, IMDB) can be done on a laptop or desktop computer, while using an app (ex, Moviemate, IMDB) can be done on a phone. These types of websites/apps usually require internet connection. If the user uses the notes on their phone, this can be done offline. If the user uses a method like Excel or Word, this requires no internet but requires them to be on specifically their device which has the file on it.

**What would the users do to complete that activity?**
>To make a list of movies to watch with others, users could use an app such as Letterboxd, Moviemate, or IMDB to create a new list, then search up films, and then add them to the list. Moviemate and IMDB offer a way to share the list with someone else. Letterboxd does not. 

### Step 3: Pick observation method(s)

* The observation methods I used were active interaction and participatory observation. I conducted this research with my sister, who both fits my target demographic and is a relative of mine. It was conducted at the UCLA dorms, in a lounge. I recorded the video and audio using Zoom, showing both the camera and the laptop screen. The materials used are below. For the interaction interview, I asked questions about what a user would desire in such an app. For the participatory observation, I asked the user to show me how she does the task (track a list of movies to watch) normally. I then asked her to do this using another website.

## Reflection

This contextual inquiry task was overall very helpful for me and gave me a lot of insights into the task of designing movie tracking apps. I feel that a large part of this is thanks to me having a participant that was naturally good at the task. She did a good job in explaining her opinions, what she desires in a movie tracking app, and what she doesn't like about the existing apps. Furthermore, it happened to be that she does use methods for film tracking (not all people care about film enough to do that), and the methods she uses are different than the ones I previously researched, and she was new to the method I asked her to use.

However, there were things that unexpectedly caught me by surprise. For one, I did not choose IMDB as one of the two sites I would research. This was partly because I myself saw it as a less-visually-pleasing version of Letterboxd. However, one thing I learned in this session is that IMDB has features that Letterboxd does not have. For example, IMDB has trivia about each movie, and it displays the synopsis of movies in lists. Another unexpected thing that happened is that, sometime very very recently, Letterboxd must have started rolling out an option for shared movie lists. This was not there when I last used the site, which was recently. I learned that participants can show you about methods or features that you did not think about yourself, and they can give an entirely different perspective on a website. Next time, I would check the website interfaces again just before the interview, to check whether they updated anything.

Overall, this contextual inquiry was more free-form and open than the usability testing. There was more opportunity to follow up and discuss with the participant.
