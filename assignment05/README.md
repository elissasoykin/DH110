# Low-Fidelity Prototype
## DH 110: Assignment 5

### Description
My project is focused on movie tracking and creating movie lists. More specifically, this app will provide a way for users to create shared, collaborative movie lists. They will be able to choose who to share a list with, and choose the permissions that those people have. In my user research, I found that some apps don’t have (in some cases, present, and in other cases, clear) home buttons. I also found that users may want to customize the information they can include in lists. I also discovered that some users highly value seeing the synopsis and actual textual information about movies as they are using apps. I aimed to take these findings into account. In my persona design, I detailed two types of users who I envision using my app. One persona was focused on creating her own new lists, naming the lists, adding movies to them, and sharing the lists with other users. Another persona was interested in browsing through movies and finding movies that are similar to a given film. So, these were the Task 1 and Task 2 that I chose. The purpose of this low-fidelity prototype is to model how the app will actually look once developed. Since it is in early stages of development, this low-fidelity prototype allows me to reconsider my design choices and go through revisions. It will make clear what features or functionalities are missing. It also will allow me to test my design idea with actual users, to see if what they do matches what I imagine in my head. 

### List of tasks supported in prototype
- Go to home page
- Go to menu
- Go to my lists
- Create a new list
- Add title to new list
- Share new list with users and choose permissions
- Search and add movies to new list
- Save new list
- Click on a movie to go to it’s page
- Browse through movies similar to a given movie

### User testing
While my user could successfully complete both tasks, there was some confusion and unexpected actions along the way. In task 1, the user clicked on the menu, but instead of clicking on only “my lists”, they also tried to click on “shared lists” and “profiles”. Although my prototype is not completely fledged out yet, it seems that the user could reasonably expect that there could be a way to access a list creation button from those pages as well. Also, when adding collaborators to share the list with while making a new list, the user was at first confused about which screen it would return to. This is probably because it is hard to tell if a list is already shared with someone. 

In task 2, there were some issues stemming from the fact that this is a low-fidelity prototype, and I have not created every possible page yet. When asked to browse movies that are similar to a movie, the user clicked on the menu, but they considered “shared lists”, “browse movies”, and “my lists” as starting points. My prototype so far only has “my lists” as a starting point, but “shared lists” will look very similar, so it is also a valid thought, and “browse movies” will also be a way to accomplish this. Besides the task of actually getting to a movie, the user had no issue with finding a set of similar movies. 

### Summary and reflection
In summary, for the most part, the testing went smoothly. The user overall took similar actions to what I intended and imagined. There were, however, some difficulties the user encountered. Most of these stemmed from the fact that this is only a low-fidelity prototype and I have not modeled all the pages/features yet. These mostly included that multiple menu options could be starting points in a user’s journey. A different issue was that, in some cases, when creating a new list, it is hard to see if the “share” field has been edited. The user had a difficult time knowing which screen to return to after editing the collaborators. To fix this, I would add a little preview of the information in the “share” box so the users could have more feedback to tell whether their action was successful. The user experienced a similar issue after adding the first movie to the list; they had to look carefully to find the screen which had a movie added. I wanted it to be more clear, but it was affected by my limited screen size. To fix this, I will shift the buttons upwards, so that there is more space on the bottom of the screen, so that users can clearly see if movies have been added or not.

I learned that preparing a low-fidelity prototype requires effort and hard work. Even without the aesthetic details, there are so many things to consider when designing the screen layouts, text, and buttons. The information should be clear and present. It should be not too wordy and cluttered, but at the same time, it shouldn’t have too little words or information. In the future, I will probably first do a rough sketch of my prototype, so I can better anticipate how screens will come together.
