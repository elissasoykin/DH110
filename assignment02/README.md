## Pilot Usability Test

### Introduction

Moviemate is an app that is designed for making lists of movies and sharing them with other people. Users can make accounts, search for movies, add them to lists, and then share those lists with other accounts and edit the lists.

After conducting a heuristic analysis on this app, I found several usability problems. 

- There is little felixibility and control for users. Users cannot edit the order of the items in a list. The only way to do so is by deleting all the following items in the list, deleting that item, and then re-adding the rest again.
- The system status is not always clear. If a user deletes an item from a list, there aren't pop-ups to indicate if this was successful.
- There is not always a match between the system and the real world. The "Home" page is the searchable movie database, while the lists are on their own secondary page.
- The actions are not always consistent or standard. If clicking through a chain of movies, the navigation menu on the bottom disappears, and the only way to return to the main screen is to click through all of the back buttons. 

To further investigate these problems, I will conduct a usability test to evaluate users' opinions on this app. I want to test how easy and helpful Moviemate is for tracking lists of movies. The purpose of a usability test is to investigate the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of the product; the aim is to understand the issues with the app from the user's perspective. In Task 1, I will ask the user to search for movies and add them to one list. This task will test the overall main goal of the app, and more specifically, it will test how the user responds to the issue of the Home page and the Watch Lists page being somewhat unintuitive. In Task 2, I will ask the user to edit the list (deleting items, re-ordering items). This will test the lack of flexibility and control for users, as it will show how users respond to there being no way to change the order of items in the list. It also concerns system status, as there might not be confirmation of changes saved to the list. In Task 3, I will ask the user to find related movies to a particular movie. This is intentionally designed to lead them down a chain of movie pages, and I then ask them to navigate to the main page. This tests the consistency issue where the navigation menu on the bottom disappears in a chain of movie pages. Afterwards, the questionnaire aims to find out how satisfied, dissatisfied, and comfortable the user feels with the app.

## Methodology

I will conduct the usability test at a desk in my quiet apartment. I will sit next to the user.

I will use my Windows laptop and my iPhone. I will start a Zoom call on my laptop and turn on the camera; I will then join as a participant from my iPhone and share the screen (this will be opened to Moviemate and will be used for recording the user's actions on the app). I will also show the UT survey form on my laptop screen. I will record my entire laptop screen and audio with Fine Screen Recorder.

I will go through the UT survey form with the user. I will first tell them background information and ask for their informed consent. The user then goes through a pre-test questionnaire about previous use and first impressions. The user then does Tasks 1, 2, and 3. Afterwards, the user does the post-test questionnaire, where they give their opinions on how satisfied and comfortable they are with the app. Finally, the user will complete demographic data.

## Reflection

I learned valuable information from this pilot test, although there were unexpected issues along the way. For one, I found that the user did explain his thoughts for the tasks, but did not explain them as much during the post-test questionnaire, which is contrary to what I expected. Even though I tried to encourage the user to share his thoughts, it may have been "gut-feeling" decisions that cannot be explained in words. Besides that, I found it hard at times to know how much I could tell the user. I also sometimes wanted to tell the user where to look to do something, but I tried to refrain from doing so. For future testing, I would build the user's opinions/thoughts into the UT form, maybe as free response questions, to make sure I get more data. The tasks went smoothly overall, as the user explained his thoughts, and there were no technical issues.

I learned that the app has another issue with consistency that I did not notice earlier. When going through a chain of movies, the back arrow changed positions at one point. I also learned that from the user's perspective, the back button is small and hard to find on the screen. Additionally, I learned that the user had critiques related to deleting movies from a list; he had more criticisms than I thought of initially. For example, he tried several actions for editing a list and moving the items into a different order, and they all deleted items from the list, which he said was unintuitive.
