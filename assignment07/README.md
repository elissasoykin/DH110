# High-Fidelity Prototype
## DH 110 - assignment 7
### Elissa Soykin


## Description
In this project, I am designing a website and app for movie-tracking. Specifically, this platform will allow users to browse through a database of movies, create their own lists and add movies to lists, share these lists with specified users, and work on shared, collaborative movie lists that other users have invited them to contribute to.

This process has involved many steps, including first brainstorming the needs of users who would use this app, then creating initial/low-fidelity wireframes and wireflows. After that, I edited and clean up my wireframes. I then selected one wireframe, and made many variations. I tested several variations of grid layouts, then typography, then shapes, and then colors. Finally, I created a high-fidelity prototype. To do this, I first applied my interface design standards to my wireframes. I then added interactivity and animations (to link frames and show what each button click does).

This high-fidelity prototype will let me try to simulate the app and recreate the experience that the user will have when using my app. It allows for realistic testing with participants, so I can see what difficulties or confusion they have with the interface.
