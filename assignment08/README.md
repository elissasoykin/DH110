# Introduction
In this project, I have designed an app for film tracking, specifically with a focus on making (collaborative) movie lists. Users of this app can browse through a database of movies, create their own lists and add movies to lists, share these lists with specified users, and work on shared, collaborative movie lists that other users have invited them to contribute to. Keeping track of movies that a person has watched or wants to remember to watch later is very valuable to those interested in film. Adding a collaborative component will facilitate bonding and discussion between friends who want to watch movies together.

# Design Statement
While apps and websites for movie tracking exist, they rarely offer the opportunity to have collaborative, shared movie lists. My app specifically aims to give users the biggest range of options and control over who can see their lists, whether it is publicly visible to anyone, visible to specified users, or visible and editable by certain users.

# Competitor Analysis
I conducted a heuristic analysis on 2 existing products that aim to address similar goals: Moviemate and Letterboxd.

Moviemate has a sleek, clean design, and it can more or less accomplish the most critical parts of the task at hand. However, it is lacking in various aspects. This is mostly because in many areas, it has a lack of features and flexibility. For example, users can't change the date they watched a movie, they can't change the order of items in a list, and they can't add items to a list from within the list itself. Also, the 3 buttons on the bottom ("Home", "Watchlists", and "Profile") disappear when clicking on even one movie, and if following a chain of similar movies afterwards. A pro is that it allows for both movies and TV shows, but a con is that it is only mobile-based and has no browser version. Overall, Moviemate lacks in visibility of system status, consistency and standards, help and documentation, and felxibility.

Letterboxd is impressive and comprehensive in the features and functionalities it offers. It is also visually pleasing, with a clean, modern aesthetic. However, Letterboxd can not accomplish my goal of creating a collaborative, shared, group watchlist. For one, Letterboxd lists are either private to only the creator or public to anyone on the internet. Second, even public lists do not allow for multiple editors. Furthermore, Letterboxd has some other issues. For example, the search bar is completely incapable of handling even a single typo in the name of a film, actor, director, etc. Also, there are many ads, which make it slow to load. One plus of Letterboxd which Moviemate does not have and would be especially important for a family app, is that you can add notes and descriptions to movies in lists. Overall, Letterboxd lacks in user control and freedom, recognition rather than recall, and recovery from errors.

I then conducted a usability test on Moviemate. I found similar results. Users cannot edit the order of the items in a list. The only way to do so is by deleting all the following items in the list, deleting that item, and then re-adding the rest again. If a user deletes an item from a list, there aren't pop-ups to indicate if this was successful. If clicking through a chain of movies, the navigation menu on the bottom disappears, and the only way to return to the main screen is to click through all of the back buttons.
