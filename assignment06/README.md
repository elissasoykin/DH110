# Interface Design
## DH 110 - assignment 6


### Description
In this project, I am designing a website and app for movie-tracking. Specifically, this platform will allow users to browse through a database of movies, create their own lists and add movies to lists, share these lists with specified users, and work on shared, collaborative movie lists that other users have invited them to contribute to.

This process has involved many steps, including first brainstorming the needs of users who would use this app, then creating initial/low-fidelity wireframes and wireflows. After that, I edited and clean up my wireframes. I then selected one wireframe, and made many variations. I tested several variations of grid layouts, then typography, then shapes, and then colors. 

This interface design will allow me to have one standard and unified set of design styles, that I will apply throughout the rest of my app. It allows me to see any issues, and whether there are things the users do not like about the current style choices.

### Impression test
Key Points: 
- "I like the font; it's clean, neat, and aesthetic"
- "I like how the buttons add a pop of color"
- "In the dark mode though, maybe the banner color could be changed? It seems to not pop out as much as the buttons do"
- "For other pages or screens, maybe you could add more additional colors into the scheme"
- "You could try making the 3 buttons the same size and see how that looks"

Summary of findings: 
Overall, my tester liked the fonts; he liked that it was consistent, and he thought the different sizes used made sense for the different purposes. He didn't seem to have issues with readability. Besides that, most of the comments dealt with color. The color in the buttons was a positive addition. As of now, the buttons and header are the same color, but my tester said that the header did not stand out as much as the buttons in the light mode. He also said that I might want to add more colors into my color scheme to make it more varied. I will try playing around with the colors, and with changing the button sizes.

### Decision-making process for final graphical interface design
For the color schemes, I decided to go with a mostly black-and-white design with dark blue as the accent colors. The reason for the mostly black-and-white is that, since this site is for reading about movies, finding movies, and making lists of movies, I wanted the focus to be on the content. Specifically, the page for a movie may be the first time that a user hears about a movie, or it might be representative of the movie in their minds; in any case, the aesthetic of the page can strongly subconsciously influence their perceptions of the movie. For example, the user might have the "look", "feel", and aesthetic of the movie on the page influenced by the aesthetic of the user interface itself. For this reason, I chose a mostly black-and-white scheme, without harsh or attention-stealing colors. I chose blue because it is typically associated with calmness.

For the typography, I chose Inter, because I wanted a clean, modern, sans serif font. Although the film practice is old, this app is new and designed to keep up with a modern aesthetic and modern audience. As a result, I wanted a neat, clean, aesthetic, sans serif font. Inter is very readable and legible. I chose it over Rubik because Rubik skewed the text slightly.

For the corner roundness, I chose 10px. My buttons were initially entirely rectangular (0px). I also tried 25px. I found that I did not like the very round buttons, because they seemed to cheapen the look in this particular case, and didn't seem to fit in the sleek and sophisticated, dark design that I was going for. However, I realized I didn't want the buttons to be entirely rectangular either, because then it would be hard to distinguish clickable buttons from decorative boxes or just other non-interactive rectangles. So, I went with 10px, which is sligthly rounded.

For the grid layout, I used 5 columns (margin 16, gutter 8), 14 rows (margin 16, gutter 8). The 14 rows allowed me to separate the elements vertically. I found that 5 columns worked well because some of my items filled 3 out of 5 columns. In terms of the layout, I first put the movie poster as the biggest item, as these are intended to set the tone for a movie (a picture is worth a thousand words, and people often judge a book by its cover). Under that, I have the film title as the biggest text on the screen, since it is the most important information on this page. Right below it, the year and genre are tab-separated and bold, and underneath that is the synposis, in the same size but not bold. The user gets the most important and quickest information at the top, which then gets more detailed near the bottom. Below this, I have the clickable buttons, which bring users to other pages. Underneath is the list of lists the film was mentioned in, which the user can scroll through.
